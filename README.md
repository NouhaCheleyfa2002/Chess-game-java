A fully functional desktop chess application developed with Java Swing, featuring an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) and complete chess rules implementation.

The project includes:

Frontend (Java Swing GUI) – intuitive chessboard with draggable pieces.

Game Logic – full implementation of chess rules: legal moves, check, checkmate, castling, pawn promotion, and en passant.

OOP Design – built with object-oriented principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation) for modularity and scalability.

Standalone Application – lightweight, runs directly as a desktop app with no external dependencies.
